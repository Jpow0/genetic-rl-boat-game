# genetic-rl-boat-game

A small project with **genetic reinforcement learning** in a real-time boat game, built in Python.

## Overview

This project explores genetic reinforcement learning through a simple boat simulation.  
Agents are controlled by small neural networks whose weights evolve over time via  
**selection, mutation, and crossover** — no backpropagation involved.

## Features

- Real-time visual simulation
- Evolution-based reinforcement learning
- Continuous control
- No gradients. No dataset. Just simulation-based learning.

## Libraries

- NumPy  
- Ursina  
- Pandas  

## Demo

## In Progress 

- Improve the reward system  
- Add a "Play Test" button  
- Optional toggle for fancy graphics  
- Export best weights/biases and scores to Excel  
- Simple dashboard or plots to visualize learning
