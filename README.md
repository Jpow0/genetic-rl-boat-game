# genetic-rl-boat-game

A simple genetic reinforcement learning algorithm tested in a real-time boat game, in Python.

## Overview

This project explores **genetic reinforcement learning** using a real-time boat simulation.  
Agents are controlled by small neural networks whose weights are evolved through **selection, mutation, and crossover**, without backpropagation.

## Key Features

- Real-time visual simulation
- Neuroevolutionary reinforcement learning
- Continuous control
- No gradients, no dataset

## Librarys

- NumPy
- Ursina
- Pandas

## Demo

## In Progress

- Improve the reward system
- Add a "Play Test" button
- Add an option to turn off fancy graphics
- Export best weights/biases and scores to Excel
- Add a simple dashboard or graphs to visualize learning
